## Monday March 7, 2014

I usually have an online syllabus with a link for each day's notes.

In that page, I can put whatever resources are needed for that class day.

```{r}
library( mosaic )
```

## Today's Resources

* A Google Spreadsheet: [editing link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dEtyWGxpWWFsN3Z0OUlZNG5xYmRVWWc&usp=sharing) and [fetching](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Am13enSalO74dEtyWGxpWWFsN3Z0OUlZNG5xYmRVWWc&single=true&gid=0&output=csv)

To fetch, cut and paste the following from this page into R

```{r}
ourData <- fetchGoogle("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Am13enSalO74dEtyWGxpWWFsN3Z0OUlZNG5xYmRVWWc&single=true&gid=0&output=csv")
```
